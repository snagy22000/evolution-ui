      <h1>Text to Speech (Innovative)</h1>
      <p>The Text2Speech component, reads all data which gets selected by the user. It uses the Web Speech API. It can be used
        by using the commands <span class="evo_c-text2speech"> Shift+b </span> to get started and <span class="evo_c-text2speech">  Shift+v </span>        to cancel or the control panel <span class="evo_c-text2speech">on the left side.</span> Select first the text and then
        <span class="evo_c-text2speech"> push the start/stop button</span>
      </p>

        Successful people maintain a positive focus in life no matter what is going on around them. They stay focused on their past
        successes rather than their past failures, and on the next action steps they need to take to get them closer to the
        fulfillment of their goals rather than all the other distractions that life presents to them. Jack Canfield. I've
        missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game
        winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. Michael
        Jordan. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what
        you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet,
        keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. Steve Jobs.
